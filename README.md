# chainsmokers-website
Interactive Design - Assignment 1 (Ee Jun Kai Julian) (15/11/2020)

# Introduction
This website is a remake of the official Chainsmoker's website. The Chainsmokers are a very well-known American electronic DJ and production duo. Their current website seems to be a little outdated and seem quite messy especially their online store.

Therefore, this project is to focus on optimizing the website to allow new users to navigate through the pages and to look for more information/latest news on the duo easily.

## Design Process

* **Newcomers**
    * They will be able to learn about the duo on their "About" webpage. For example, the history of the iconic duo, how did it all started, their older music albums or more about each of the duo.

* **Fans**
    * The fans will be able to keep up with the latest news on the duo or the upcoming albums that will be releasing.
    * They will be able to pre-order the upcoming albums or even purchase merchandise at the store.
    * Fans will be able to view the upcoming shows/converts that the duo will be holding and they will also get the chance to book slots for the shows.

* **Media & General Public**
    * Check out the social media of the Chainsmokers to reach out to them.
    * Check out their old to new albums and learn more about the duo.

1. On the music webpage of The Chainsmokers' website, I gained some inspiration to have embedded Spotify playlists.

1. I received inspiration from the **Panic! At the Disco website**. I really like their idea on having a full on page background as their home page and when you click on the down arrow, it does a scroll effect. I think it looks very neat.
